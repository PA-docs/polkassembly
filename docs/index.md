## Governance Unleashed!

---

## Welcome to Polkassembly

Polkassembly is the governance forum for the Polkadot and Kusama network along with the majority of its parachains.

The goal of Polkassembly is to enable the hosting of a decentralized, transparent, and inclusive process for making decisions about the direction and development of the Polkadot and Kusama network along with its parachains.

It is a platform where users can propose and vote on changes to the network, such as updates to the protocol, the addition of new features, or the allocation of funds.

## How it works?

Users who hold a certain amount of the platformâ€™s native cryptocurrency are eligible to participate in on-chain governance on Polkassembly by proposing and voting on proposals.

This is done through on-chain voting, which means that the voting process is recorded on the blockchain and is transparent and verifiable.

For example, DOTs are the native tokens in the case of Polkadot. Any DOT token holder has the power to participate in voting for Polkadot Governance on Polkassembly.

## Why is On-Chain Governance needed?

On-chain voting has several benefits for the governance of a network. The most prominent ones can be summarized as:

1. **Greater participation and inclusivity**: Anyone with a sufficient amount of native tokens can participate in the voting process.
2. **Transparent and verifiable voting process**: All votes are recorded on the blockchain and can be publicly audited. This helps to prevent fraud and ensures that the outcome of the voting process accurately reflects the will of the community.
